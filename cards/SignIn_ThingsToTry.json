To check that you’ve entered your password correctly, hold down the icon resembling an eye that appears next to it to reveal your password.\n- If you recently changed your password, try entering your previous password. If this works, you’ll need to lock your device and then unlock it using your new password.\n- If you have multiple accounts on your device, try signing in with another account.\n- There are multiple ways to sign in. On the Lock screen, select 'Sign in options' to choose an alternate method to sign in. For example, if you are trying to type in a PIN, switch to a password login method.",
